1. Project Vision:
To develop a robust, secure, and intuitive software platform that empowers traders without advanced programming skills to create, backtest, and deploy automated algorithmic trading strategies through a visual, no-code interface.

2. Core Objectives:

Democratize Algo-Trading: Lower the technical barrier to entry for quantitative trading.

Ensure Reliability: Build a system that is fault-tolerant, accurate in calculations, and secure in its operations.

Provide Actionable Insights: Offer comprehensive backtesting and analysis tools to validate strategy performance.

Simplify Execution: Seamlessly integrate with brokerage APIs for reliable paper and live trading.

3. Detailed Functional Requirements:

Module 1: The Visual Strategy Builder (The "Brain")

Description: A drag-and-drop canvas where users build strategies using pre-defined logical blocks.

Features:

Block Library: A palette of visual blocks representing:

Data Sources: "Market Data (OHLCV)", "Technical Indicator (e.g., SMA, RSI, Bollinger Bands)", "External Data Feed".

Logic & Conditions: "IF/THEN/ELSE" conditions, "AND/OR" operators, comparison operators (>, <, ==, crossover).

Actions: "Place Buy Order", "Place Sell Order", "Set Stop-Loss", "Set Take-Profit", "Close Position".

Risk Management: "Position Sizing (% of equity)", "Maximum Drawdown Halt".

Flow Creation: Users connect blocks to define the strategy's decision-making workflow.

Parameterization: Every block must be highly configurable (e.g., setting the period for an SMA, the order type - market/limit, the stop-loss value).

Module 2: The Backtesting Engine (The "Time Machine")

Description: A high-fidelity simulator that executes the visual strategy on historical data.

Features:

Historical Data Integration: Connect to data providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Polygon, Alpha Vantage) to download clean, adjusted historical data for stocks, crypto, forex, etc.

Event-Driven Simulation: The engine must process historical data tick-by-tick or bar-by-bar to accurately simulate execution, including slippage and transaction cost models.

Comprehensive Reporting: Generate a detailed performance report including:

Equity Curve: Visual graph of portfolio value over time.

Key Metrics: Total Return, Annualized Return, Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, Max Drawdown, Win Rate, Profit Factor.

Trade Log: A list of every simulated trade with entry/exit price, date, and PnL.

Module 3: The Paper Trading Module (The "Sandbox")

Description: A live market simulation that runs the strategy in real-time without risking real money.

Features:

Real-Time Data Feed: Integrate with WebSocket APIs from data providers to stream live market prices.

Virtual Brokerage: Maintain a virtual portfolio, tracking cash, equity, open positions, and order execution in a simulated environment.

Live Monitoring Dashboard: A UI to watch the strategy's logic fire in real-time, see placed orders, and track the virtual portfolio's performance.

Module 4: The Live Trading Agent (The "Executioner")

Description: The component that deploys the validated strategy to a live brokerage account.

Features:

Brokerage API Integration: Implement secure, reliable connectors to major broker APIs (e.g., Interactive Brokers, Alpaca, OANDA). This is the most critical and complex part.

Order Management System (OMS): Handle the entire lifecycle of an order: creation, transmission, confirmation, modification, and cancellation. Must include robust error handling for network timeouts and API errors.

Risk Safeguards: Implement pre-trade risk checks (e.g., not exceeding available capital, preventing excessive order frequency) to prevent catastrophic errors.

Module 5: User Management & Security

Description: Systems to manage users and protect their data and capital.

Features:

Secure Authentication: Multi-factor authentication (2FA).

API Key Management: Encrypt and store brokerage API keys using industry-standard practices (e.g., AES-256 encryption).

Data Privacy: Ensure all user data and strategies are kept private and secure.

4. Technical Architecture & Non-Functional Requirements:

Technology Stack:

Backend: Python (ideal for data processing, math, and numerous trading libraries like backtrader, vectorbt, ccxt), Node.js.

Frontend: React.js or Vue.js for building the complex drag-and-drop visual builder and dashboards.

Data: SQL Database (PostgreSQL) for storing user data, strategies, and historical performance. Redis for caching real-time data.

Infrastructure: Docker containerization, deployed on a cloud provider (AWS, GCP) for high availability. Must be designed to run 24/7.

Performance: The backtesting engine must be optimized for speed (potentially using parallel processing).

Reliability: The live trading agent must have near 100% uptime. Implement redundancy, heartbeat checks, and automatic restart mechanisms.

Security: This is paramount. All communications with brokers and data providers must be over SSL/TLS. API keys and secrets must never be stored in plaintext.

5. Success Criteria:

User Success: Users can successfully go from an idea -> visual strategy -> backtest -> paper trade -> live trade without writing code.

System Performance: The backtesting engine provides accurate, fast results. The live trading agent executes orders reliably with no critical bugs leading to financial loss.

Commercial Viability: The platform attracts a user base of retail traders.
